Remember, Arsene Wenger didn't think we needed to buy a striker in January. #afc
The decisive weeks have started. Need to take the next step tomorrow in Stoke..... #afc #COYG #poldi #aha #redarmy
Brilliant by The Ox, hopeless by Giroud. #afc
Usual story against any big physical team - we get bounced off the ball like weebles. #afc
Mesut Özil: Has created more chances (73) than any other player in Europe's top 5 leagues this season; Hazard second (70) #AFC
OK, Maestro @MesutOzil1088 - show all the critics just how good you really are. #afc
Liverpool will go above Arsenal with a win at Southampton later. The gap between both before the 5-1 was 8 points. #afc
#Nextmatch AFC CUP : Arema Indonesia vs Hanoi T&amp;T Vietnam. Kanjuruhan Stadium, Tuesday 11th March 2014. kick off 04.00 pm
Breaking: Arsenal making very strong enquires on Diego Costa, we understand that one of Sunday papers will also run this story. #AFC
"Let's all do the Wenger" go on then Stoke fans: Win 3 league titles, 4 F.A Cups, 4 community shields and learn to speak 6 languages...
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (2) was the only Arsenal player to create more than 1 chance against Stoke - he came on in 74th minute #AFC
Surprised Chamberlain, Flamini &amp; Özil don't start. Rare opportunity for Podolski, whilst great to see Gibbs is fit. #afc
Wenger: "I never tell Özil: 'You have to win us the game'. It's down to the team performance. I just want him to enjoy it &amp; play well." #AFC
GOAL: Stoke 1 - 0 Arsenal. Jon Walters converts the penalty for Stoke City. #SCFC #AFC
Breaking News: Santi Cazorla set to sign a new deal at Arsenal {Mail} #AFC
Truth is I cant bear this anymore. I am really not as proud to be an Arsenal fan anymore #AFC
@David_AFC_ lol ok signing a injury proned CDM isnt a fail ok
When Ramsey returns it will be a massive boast but think to much will be expected from him.
@Arsenal #Wenger is a specialist so he deserves his multi million salary. Unfortunately though, his speciality is in FAILING!! #AFC #Arsenal
Woke up as we lost to stoke :/ think it's time to buy a striker.. #AFC #Gooners
I will be leaving all my group.....except afc.. Thats a final decision!
#AFC you are allowed to play at some point today
He lost it finally "@TejiroOvie: Wenger out #AFC"
Bollocks to this, I'm having an Alan Partridge blast. Your new motor's a bad omen, @chicomeeco #afc
@InsideThierry should moan, but as of yet he hasn't
@Strongieee__33 I wouldn't be surprised if they finished higher than that tbh.
@stevewillmott this @CarlBovis_AFC moron is a 24 carat bell-end
Wow. 4-0 to Bayern in just half an hour.
@Sunny_AFC they did the same with wilshere as well a couple of years ago
Poor result today from arsenal... Oh well, bring on the next game! #afc #arsenal #stoke
@InsideThierry whatever happens this season wenger has done his job until now, if at any point he begins to fail to do his job then we
Oh well. If we lose to EFC on Saturday at least the Hope is over for another season. It's the Hope that kills you. #AFC
"@BeckArsenal: Did we really lose against fucking stoke?" Not only did we lose, we're also not allowed to criticise anything afc related
Awesome #ashestoashes riding the waves too long #afc
@CarlBovis_AFC van Persie won't give a shit about Thursday night when he looks at his title winners medal.
@AndyWhit24 @Tom_Edmonds1.. Yeah seen that, fucking jokers!
fuck yourself.. U'll NEVER be compared to #Afc, suckers-&gt;"@nudgeovstoke: Let's see what the Arsehole fans have to say tonight #scfc #stoke"
@alanhinton11 @piersmorgan £120M in the bank and doesn't buy a striker.  Ridiculous.  9 years of failure.  #AFC
@AFC_Harry34 @Arnautoviced @FA the FA and all the press hate Stoke, Fa panda to stereotypes, even though we are know where near what we were
15 minutes to kickoff !!!

SuperSport United v AFC Leopards 

Lucas Moripe Stadium, Pretoria.

#CAFCC
@David_AFC_ or maybe if falcao wants to leave monaco. Surely he'd go real or Chelsea though
And that's how the (our) cookie crumbled #afc
Can't believe we lost.....stoke good at home but still that hurts especially now Liverpool could go above us later :( #afc
Title Race Over!!! #Afc
Lobatan"@adequnle: @KoloKennethK I hear you, na Wenger &amp; His Shampoo Model Giroud cause am... #AFC"
@David_AFC_ Shouldn't even be in this position as such a big club we are
Its ova 4 AFC. Our next4 games &gt; Everton, Spurs, Chelsea, City. 3are away games @StaleMayte: I think @MrsGiroud: The league is not over yet.
Stoke tried to play in first half but resorted to all too familiar tactics as game wore on, ref let Whelan and Adam off massively #afc
Who r u telling? &lt;_&gt; @iAm_eAo: Pained #afc fan&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "@MIAz_Official: Chelsea fans can over rate hazard sha! I'd pick Cahill over him
Another trophy-less year in the making for #AFC #EPL #MUFC
Is there a reason Flamini didn't play today?

Can't help but think he might have made the difference. 
#Aggression 
#AFC
@David_AFC_ so what are you going to achieve this season then
Awwwww, so close. We need to sign Lallana next season. #AFC #differentclass
@fazjac_debra @ArsenalMoh8 @Arsenal looking at the table now, I can't see it. I want it but in my heart no chance #afc
Okay yes, Arsenal played poorly, but what IF the referee was fair by given Stoke 2 red cards? Would they've had the PK? No. 9 men vs AFC 11?
Hate the fact that we could have had Luis Suarez if we coughed up £50m. #afc
Arsenal have picked up 1 point in their last 3 Premier League away games. #afc
I've been looking for  @piersmorgan 'Boooooooooom'#afc top of the league tweet since! Reality setting in...its been a terribke week 4 him
@InsideThierry now let's see who will be this summer now we have even more money thanks to puma
Be Calm Gunner Fam 
The only time a single Game means disaster is when its the last Game of the season 
We In this 
#AFC
@Tom_Edmonds1.. No quiet one, work to do tomorrow for a busy week including parent evening #Zzzz
I Can't Express How Much I Hate Dropping Points At The Most Crucial Times #AFC
#arsenal @arsenal #afc #wengerout get out wenger
@piersmorgan Making top four is looking very slim for Arsenal #AFC
@mj_afc Ugh, I'd blanked out the Anfield annihilation. These strong words lose their effect if used too much, don't they?
