@Grace_UCweb @UCBrowser moto g
@wonderwallgurl hey no biggie. Get Moto g. It‚Äôs really good.
@stalkhold but Pebbl Steel awesome hay yaar :D and no, its expensive than Moto G!
Moto G and Pebble Steel cost same. Hhmmm
@wonderwallgurl if your wallet allows it get the Moto x. It‚Äôs a superior version Moto g.
@geekyranjit sir what kind of battery widget you use on moto g plz reply plz plz
@joenrv¬†did you know that the Moto G codename is falcon?
@tweetyourbobby Timely software &amp; hardware upgradation is the key factor of staying at the top. Motorola did same with #Moto G. What say?
Else, Moto G ftw
@CA_MayurBiyani Nice! Thanks for sharing this valuable review of #Moto G with us!
@infibeam ven cn we xpect moto g 4 sale? its comin soon 4evr. :(
was getting "network error please check the network" error on moto g. searched through forums and found Best Wallpaper HD app was causing it
@MysteryCr8tve I'm currently rocking a Google Play Edition Moto G. Simple, but does what I need and genuinely lasts a whole day. Cheap too
@MysteryCr8tve Nexus 5 and Moto X are solid choices. Or even the Moto G if you want really good battery life.
Thankyou @Flipkart For My MOTO G Very Happy Tysm :)
@Motorola Is it OK to change Moto G Shells everyday? I mean, I'm worry about its back.
@flipkartsupport still out of stock... Seems like it's easy to get a moto g than flip covers
@PriyaRaju Looks like they might be flooded with Moto G buyers :) @Flipkart
Can't lie this Moto G battery lasts all damn day!
@Snapdeal_Help where is moto g on snapdeal? Is it ever coming?
Addicted to Deer hunter game in my Moto G Battery drying because of my excessive playing
@UCBrowser i am using moto g
Why is it so difficult to get accessories for Moto G in Qatar? Been waiting for a long time. Hope I get it this weekend.
@kaylanasha @AndroidAuth and I'm moving my Moto G
@DVB04561296 We love the Moto G! It does come with Kit Kat software preinstalled. ^SO
just last week i was buying moto g :)
@kartefact Ambiguous tweet. Meant to say - if Moto G has one, why doesn't the Nexus. Can't even do anything cuz hardware not present.
The Moto G has a radio? Why would you not have the hardware component itself, Google? Huh? So much pain.
Moto G is back on stock in Flipkart. Both 16 GB and 8 GB are now available. #motogonflipkart #motog
@mikekilpatrick Secondhand Note 2. If it wasn't for the space, Moto G would be the obvious choice! Shame no SD slot on that.
@rorytate I think Moto X or G are my flavour. Nexus 5. All low purchase price off contract.
#vmtester really hope I get to test the new Moto g üòÅüòâ
@DantesJudgement so hence why I'm thinking android, risk is too high when getting a 2nd hand iPhone, can't afford new moto g it is
@rorytate looking at Moto G now. Dual sim is ideal.
@DantesJudgement ... So looking at moto g for the price it seems great checked reviews and all mostly positive the niggles I can live with
@Flipkart. Moto g 16GB is not available in noida whereas 8GB is available. I want to order a 16GB please help
the $99 no-contract Moto-G phones would be very okay Android phones if only they had SD card slots (and 2.5X more free RAM and app storage)
@gabets_ moto g
@TomyFernandez14 moto g
Omg "I want a plan under sixty with two geebee of data. I don't care about the phone"

"Okay so Moto g for 52..."

"Not that phone"
#vmtester, I just applied for the moto G quite an amazing phone the successor to the Moto X
@virginmobilecan I was thinking a new phone would look great with my outfit. I would tweet a pic to show you if I had a moto g #vmtester
Moto G vs Venmo Lucas 5C comparison review: Save money or get the iPhone 5S ...
Getting a new phone ‚àö
Repurposing the old one into a music player ‚àö
In a side note, I really like the moto G. Good job Motorola!
noticed on a forum n read about the BlackBerry z3,looks like a moto g killer. 
I really want BlackBerry to survive, have always admired them
moto g amanha aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah n aguento mais esperar :3
@KateSherrod I'm gonna get a Moto G. Inexpensive (for an unlocked phone) but it apparently does everything I need, plus it has good reviews.
Today I saw someone selling the Moto G ($200 usd in amazon) in 15k bsf. $200 = 2.8k bsf. Fucking crazy, man.
Just applied to be a #vmtester for the Moto G. #itsbettertobeamember @virginmobilecan
